# Qiskit Aqua Tutorials

In the Qiskit ecosystem, [Aqua](https://qiskit.org/aqua) is the element that encompasses quantum algoritms and applications
for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers.  This repository used to contain the Aqua tutorials.  However,
all the Aqua tutorials (algorithms, chemistry, artificial intelligence, optimization, and finance)
have been moved to the [Qiskit-tutorial repository](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial), which includes all the Qiskit
tutorials.  You can clone the Qiskit-tutorial repository to access all the existing Aqua notebooks and/or contribute new
ones.  **This repository will be deleted in January 2019.**

## Featured Tutorials
A few noteworthy Aqua notebooks are available as
[Qiskit Notebooks](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/tree/master/qiskit/aqua).

## Additional Tutorials
A large number of Aqua notebooks containing more examples on how to use and/or contribute quantum algorithms and applications
are available as [Community Notebooks](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/tree/master/community/aqua).
