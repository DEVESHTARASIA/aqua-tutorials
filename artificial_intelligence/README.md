# Qiskit AQUA Artificial Intelligence Tutorials, Samples and Input Files

Qiskit AQUA Artificial Intelligence is a set of tools, algorithms and software for use with quantum computers to 
carry out research and investigate how to take advantage of quantum computing power to solve artificial intelligence
problems. 

Qiskit AQUA Artificial Intelligence translates artificial-intelligence-specific problems into inputs
for a quantum algorithm residing in Qiskit AQUA, which in turn uses [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/) for the relevant
quantum computation. 

This folder contains some Jupyter Notebook examples. There are Python code files too.

For more detail see the main [index](../index.ipynb#artificial_intelligence)

## Input files

The folder [input_files](input_files) contains a number of example JSON input files that can be loaded 
and run by the Qiskit AQUA [GUI](https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua/README.md#gui) or by the Qiskit AQUA
[command line](https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua/README.md#command-line) tool.
